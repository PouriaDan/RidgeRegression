# RidgeRegression

Least squares Linear Regression with L2 Regularization

## Usage
Initialize RidgeRegression class
Use Fit method to for features and target to a Linear model
Use predict method to predict targets by the linear approximation

```
rr = RidgeRegression()
rr.fit(X,Y)
preds = rr.predict(X)
```
